    "As can be seen, altough the mean image for each class looks pretty good, the generated samples are nothing like real handwritten digits. This is due to the low complexity of the model (assuming both independence and binarization of the pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The total accuracy was found to be 0.83, which is pretty good considering how simplified this model is. The confusion matrix plotted below shows that while the there is a relative high accuracy for each class, there are quite a few miss classifications, where the highest error (confusion) occurs for the digits pair 3 and 5, the pair 4 and 9, and to somewhat less extent also the pair 3 and 8 (note that the confusion is **not symmetric**).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find the optimal threshold for binarization, is to divide the trainning set into train and validation sets (maybe using k-fold cross validation), estimate the accuracy for different threshold values, and evaluate which would be the best threshold based on the resulting accuracy. Although there are also works on generalizin the ROC curve for multiclass problems (for example, see: [A simplified extension of the Area under the ROC to the multiclass domain](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/a9p19/papers/prasa_06_vuc.pdf), and [R pROC package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pROC/pROC.pdf)), the ROC curve won't be too helpful in this case, as the binarization threshold does not set the point on the TPR-FPR balance directly. \n",

    "Regardless, there are better approaches in image processing for image binarization, but this is another scope completely."

'\n '\\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\"\n '\\n\\n  So.

But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\\n    in Lebanon.  \\n\\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.

It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n'\n '88 toyota Camry - Top Of The Line Vehicle\\nblue book $10,500\\nasking 9,900.\\n\\n73 k miles\\nauto transmission\\n \\nHas Everything!\\n\\nowned by a meticulous automoble mechanic\\n\\ncall (408) 425-8203 ask for Bob.'\n \"\\nHad an '83 Alliance for a long time.

What you are saying is\\nmore or less heresy.  You might call it \"infallibilism\".  It\\'s the\\nidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.\\nThis is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.\\n\\nThe Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and\\nwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can\\nmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.\\n\\nA couple historical examples come to mind.\\n\\nBishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the\\nEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning\\nPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop\\nGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though\\nmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even\\nwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just\\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\\n\\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn\\'t quite get around to\\ndefining it.  Now there\\'s no way this is compatible with Catholic\\ndoctrine.  The Pope\\'s doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\\nChurch.\\n\\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\\ninto heresy or schism.'\n '\\nThere is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the\\nsame side).

First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\\'t even \\nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s the moral of this story? I\\'m not sure.

What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.'\n '...\\n\\nIn reply to mail queries; I don\\'t know if a video is available yet.

The Pens may not loose\\none game in the playoffs.'\n '\\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I\\'m not trying to be\\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\\n\\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\\n   Pope\\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.'\n \"  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the\\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.\\n  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole\\ndebate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the\\nfield say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the\\nFeds.

Deputy\\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\\n\\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\\n\\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\\n\\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\\nStriker, the Weaver\\'s yellow lab, started toward them barking\\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\\n\\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\\n\\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\\n\\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\\nand fired.  He didn\\'t bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\\nBill\\'s arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\\n\\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn\\'t you?\"  Nevin also\\npointed out that in last September\\'s testimony, Cooper had\\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\\ndecided that Thursday\\'s account was correct.  Nevin continued the\\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\\nhim [no answer was available].\\n\\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\\n\\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\\n\\nDrew\\n==============================================================\\n'\n '\\n\\nIf a landlord sells an apartment building \"vacant\" to another landlord\\nand fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out\\non the street all of a sudden.

Luke's prolog is\\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \\n\\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\\n\\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\\nCentury.

The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been\\nthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not \\nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\\n\\n->\\tSome reasons why he wouldn\\'t be a liar are as follows.  Who would \\n->die for a lie?  Wouldn\\'t people be able to tell if he was a liar?

As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \\nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,\\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\\n\\n->\\tNiether was he a lunatic.

That is the logical pitfall that those who\\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \\npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n->write I will use it.\\n\\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to make\\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.

It \\n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.

As\\nfar as I can tell it\\'s just another \"chic\" clothes spot. Although it would be\\ninteresting if they were selling \"virtual clothing\"....\\n\\nE-mail me if you want me to dig up their phone # and you can probably get\\nsome promotional lit.'\n '\\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call.

On the\\n-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.\\n\\nNo, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \"a little bit\\nand an anachronism.\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are\\nan anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the \\npeople.  These representatives of the people have already decided\\nthat the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\\ncases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \\ninterpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\\nof the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\\nof the people using their power of government.

The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \\nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \\nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \\nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \\nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \\na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \\ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \\nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \\nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \\nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \\ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \\nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \\non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \\nthat and get cloture?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \\nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \\nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \\ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \\nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \\nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \\npressure not to do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \\nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \\neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \\nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \\nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \\nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \\nAmericans out of work.

Don was holding a hot dog that\\nhe bought from the concession stand.\\n\\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\\nof me. Beauty.\"\\n\\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\\nthe arenas in the NHL.\\n\\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\\n\\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\\nand the AHL championships.\\n\\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\\nwent cold.\\n\\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team...

Mostly, that means water\\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \\nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\\n\\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\"\n \"\\n\\tI totally agree with each point you made.

He was a man\\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\\nbasis of individual incidents.

End of part 10 of 14 --------\\n'\n 'Hello,\\n\\nI already tried our national news group without success.\\n\\nI tried to replace a friend\\'s original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC\\nwith a normal TEAC drive.\\nI already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted\\npin 6 (5.25\"/3.5\" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins\\n8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.\\nThe computer doesn\\'t complain about a missing FD, but the FD\\'s light\\nstays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,\\nbut I can\\'t access it.\\nThe TEAC works fine in a normal PC.\\n\\nAre there any points I missed?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\tVolkmar\\n'\n \"\\nIf he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the\\none who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*\\nbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\\nthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\\nOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\\nimprove on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\\nendeavor).\\n\\n\\nDo you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?\\nAre you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management\\npolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or\\ndecrease available traction?  Braking?\\n\\nIt is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum\\nswerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most\\nof his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency\\nsituation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.\\n\\n\\nI disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which\\nteach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner\\nthat is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the\\ncourse.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that\\npoint, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a\\nrider's ability.

You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \\nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).

Science is a human activity and as such,\\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\n: So, back to the original question:\\n\\n: And objective morality is.....?\\n\\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \\nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\nobjective sense.\\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\ninfinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\ndoesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.

Since standard colormaps\\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\\nCLUT.\\n\\nI don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's\\ncalled under X11R5).\\n\\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\\nthat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one\\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\\n\\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\\n-- \"\n '\\n\\nBowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style\\nplayer.

'\n 'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object.

Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\\n   any specified angle.\\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\\n   region of an image.\\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\\n   keyword values for a set of images.\\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.'\n '\\nWhere did you read this?  I don\\'t think this is true.  I think most\\nmedical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult\\nto prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some\\nthings that have just been found \"to work\", but we have no good\\nexplanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific\\nrationale.  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is\\nprobably hormone therapy.  It has been \"proven\" to work.  So have\\nradiation and chemotherapy.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\\n\"\n '\\n\\nWell, it\\'s obvious that you *don\\'t* attempt, otherwise you would be aware\\nthat they *don\\'t* all \"loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian\".\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to avoid using the phrase \"is/is not christian\" because of these\\nownership issues; instead, I\\'ve tried the phrase \"Nicene christianity\" in an\\nattempt to identify the vast majority of \"christianity\" which has roughly\\nsimilar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall\\nwithin this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is\\nrejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well.'\n 'Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape\\nis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are \\nvery different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While\\nthere is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to\\nget your hands on and costs quite a bit.\\n\\n\\tIf you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an\\nNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by\\nmodem and tape them from the NTSC output.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n'\n '\\nThe computer, err, government, is your friend.

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt?

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality\\nat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs\\nrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason\\nfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the\\nmarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font\\nvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being\\nhand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted\\nTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.\\n\\nTrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting\\nof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the\\nWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can\\nbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not\\njust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.\\n\\n\\nAgain, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone\\nconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT\\nallows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs\\nin a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate\\nfor the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack\\n2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that\\nif the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.\\n\\n\\n\\nHope this clears up some of the confusion.

Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

Related FAQ\\'s\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\\n\\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \\ncomp.windows.x.  \\n\\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \\nto comp.windows.x.motif.\\n\\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\\nlittle harder because you\\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\\n\\n/*\\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\\n * than the default visual.\\n *\\n * To compile:\\n *\\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\\n *\\n * To run:\\n *\\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\\n *\\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\\n * to install.\\n */\\n\\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\\n\\ntypedef struct\\n{\\n\\tVisual\\t*visual;\\n\\tint\\tdepth;\\n} OptionsRec;\\n\\nOptionsRec\\tOptions;\\n\\nXtResource resources[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n\\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n};\\n\\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\\n\\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\\n};\\n\\n\\n\\nint\\nmain (argc, argv)\\n\\tint\\t\\targc;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**argv;\\n{\\n\\tXtAppContext\\tapp;\\t\\t/* the application context */\\n\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\t\\t/* toplevel widget */\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\t\\t/* display */\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**xargv;\\t/* saved argument vector */\\n\\tint\\t\\txargc;\\t\\t/* saved argument count */\\n\\tColormap\\tcolormap;\\t/* created colormap */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\tvinfo;\\t\\t/* template for find visual */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\t*vinfo_list;\\t/* returned list of visuals */\\n\\tint\\t\\tcount;\\t\\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\\n\\tArg\\t\\targs[10];\\n\\tCardinal\\tcnt;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*name = \"test\";\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*class = \"Test\";\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * save the command line arguments\\n\\t */\\n\\n\\txargc = argc;\\n\\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\\n\\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\\n\\t */\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\\n\\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   XtNumber (resources),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   args, cnt);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\\n\\t\\t/*\\n\\t\\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13.

What Widgets are available?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are three popular widget sets:\\n\\nAthena\\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\\n\\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\\n\\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\\nMotif\\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\\n\\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\\n\\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\\n\\t  it is poorly implemented.\\nOLIT\\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\\n\\t  implementing Sun\\'s Open Look specification.  Developed by\\n\\t  AT&T.  I\\'ve never used it so can\\'t comment on its quality.\\n\\t  I\\'ve heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\\n\\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\\n\\nXtra\\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\\n\\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\\n\\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\\n\\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I\\'ve never seen\\n\\t  them so I can\\'t comment.\\nFWF\\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\\n\\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\\n\\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\\n\\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\\n\\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\\nXcu\\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\\n\\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\\n\\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\\n\\t  widely used.\\nXs\\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\\n\\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\\nXw\\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\\n\\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\\n\\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\\n\\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\\n\\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\\n\\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\\nXo\\t- A widget set I\\'m working on.  It\\'s still primitive but you\\n\\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\\n\\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\\n\\nTbl\\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tName\\t\\tLanguage\\tVendor\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tXview\\t\\tC\\t\\tSun\\n\\tOI\\t\\tC++\\t\\tParcPlace\\n\\tInterviews\\tC++\\t\\tStanford\\n\\tTcl/tk\\t\\tC\\t\\tsprite.berkeley.edu\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\n\\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\\n\\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\\n\\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\\nprotocol for doing drag \\'n drop operations between clients.  My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\\nanyway.\\n\\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

'\n 'Kevin Mitchell\\'s sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \\npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \\nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \\nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker\\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a \\nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\\n\\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \\nargued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\\ntossed.\\n\\nThe Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \\nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s\\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson\\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\\n\\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\\n(Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\\n\\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended\\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \\nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\\nwork, striking out three.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \\nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \\nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \\nStates Bill Clinton.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \\nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \\nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \\nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \\nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \\nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \\nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \\nfound not guilty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \\nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \\nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \\nadministration and what you're trying to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \\nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \\ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \\nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \\ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \\ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \\nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \\nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \\nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \\nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \\nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \\nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \\nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \\nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \\nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \\ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \\nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \\npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \\ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \\neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \\nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \\nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \\nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \\nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \\nviolence and drugs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \\nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \\nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \\nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \\nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \\nproblems as we do.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \\ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \\nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \\nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \\nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \\nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \\ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \\nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \\nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \\nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \\nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \\nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \\nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \\nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \\nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \\nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \\nbattle?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \\nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \\nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \\neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \\ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \\nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \\nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \\nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \\nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \\nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \\nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \\nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \\nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \\nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \\nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \\nto a vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \\nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \\nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \\nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \\nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \\ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \\nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \\nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \\neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \\nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \\nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \\nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \\nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \\nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \\ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \\nhis office lately?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \\nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \\noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \\nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \\nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \\nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \\nof the budget I presented.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \\ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \\nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \\nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \\nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \\nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \\nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \\nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \\nputting the American people back to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \\nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \\nthe need for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have some questions from people who supported \\nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \\nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \\nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \\nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \\nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \\nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \\nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \\nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \\nit was going to be like this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \\npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \\nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \\nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \\nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \\nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \\npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \\nwide range of things.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \\nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \\nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \\nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \\nreal, real progress.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \\nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \\nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \\nthings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Thank you very much.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \\nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Starting lines:\\n\\n \\tSWEDEN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFINLAND\\n\\n  35.

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\\n\\nTo quote from H.S.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \"\n '\\n\\n     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.

Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain.

With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain.

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.

Personal\\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I\\'d\\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \\n \\n\\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \\ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \\npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\\n\\n\\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \\nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \\npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\\nexplore as much as possible.

A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up.

Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.

But the government announced strict security measures\\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\\n\\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\\n\\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\\nwar they say is not theirs.\\n\\n\"I have been drafted, but I won\\'t go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\\n\\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\\n\\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor\\'s office, said only 11 of 300 locals\\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\\n\\n\"The police don\\'t force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\\n\\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\\n\\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\\n\\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\\n\\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \\nthe Russians.\"\\n\\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\\n\\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \\n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\\n\\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\\nBut Baku won\\'t listen to us.\"\\n\\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \\njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\\n\\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\\n\\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \\nschool classes in their language.\\n\\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \\nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\\nAzerbaijan.\\n\\n\\n\\n'\n '\\nNever had any problem with mine...\\n\\nAre you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2\" hex?  13mm\\nis just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won\\'t fit on a GM 13mm\\nnut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric\\nthreads too.

In most of this thread, I have\\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\\nwhat is not. \\n\\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose your\\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\\ndo this.  \\n\\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \\n\\n\\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \\nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\\npresence of qi.\\n\\n\\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let\\'s face it: we cannot\\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. '\n 'I have a pair of car speakers for sale.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     '\n 'I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of\\ncryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment;\\nthe theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one\\'s personal\\n*thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable.\\n\\nPerhaps if we make a *treaty* with, say, Iceland, to restrict crypto\\nparaphernalia can a good \"end run\" around the Constitution happen...\\n(Treaties -- as someone pointed out -- has the force of any other \"law of\\nthe land\".

I was referring to the fact\\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \\'30\\'s.  For much\\nof the \\'20\\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It\\'s important to note that\\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\\'s _America_.  \"When it\\'s time to railroad,\\nyou railroad.\"\\n\\n\\n  Not off the top of my head; I\\'ll have to dig out my reference books again.\\nHowever, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the\\nNavigator\\'s Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and\\nmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be\\nshared.\\n\\n\\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\\ncan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\\nOrteig\\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\\na gov\\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\\nasked.\\n'\n '\\n\\tSerum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.

Teitz, editor; W. B.\\n\\tSaunders, 1987:\\n\\n\\tHuman glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.\\n\\n\\n\\tIndeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not\\n\\tas accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is\\n\\tthat cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the\\n\\tsample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,\\n\\thowever, results compare \"reasonably well\" with laboratory results,\\n\\talthough \"values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,\\n\\twhereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic.\"\\n\\n\\n\\tAs stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 \\n\\tpercent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect\\n\\twhole blood levels, however.  I don\\'t believe there is a well-\\n\\tdefined \"conversion factor,\" since cell metabolism will affect\\n\\tsamples to varying degrees.

Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \\npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \\nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.

If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #\\'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:\\n\\n02106@chopin.udel.edu or\\n02106@ravel.udel.edu or\\n02106@bach.udel.edu or\\n02106@brahms.udel.edu\\n\\nNO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!\\nLOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!\\n\\nShipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).\\n\\nFor all those who have bought comics

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

Kings'\n \"I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by\\nbuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile\\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\\nrandom 50mV bias.\\n\\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\\na pain in  the ass.\\n\\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\\nlike to have this box not be active.\\n\\tAny quick ideas.

As far as\\n  I can tell, you\\'re proposing the following rules of engagement\\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\\n\\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\\n     provocation is required.\\n\\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\\n\\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\\n       as document checks.\\n\\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely \\'hostile\\' intent,\\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\\n       armed response.\\n\\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\\n       if necessary.'\n \"\\n\\n\\n\\nTry the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.\\nIt's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.\\n\\nIn the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.\\nAlso, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.\\n\\nThey also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software\\nengineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,\\nand some stuff about comms.   \\n\\nThe PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and \\nX Windows programming as well)\\nanyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending\\non your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.\\n\\nThe one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought\\ninvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -\\nthis would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but\\nwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough\\ncourse.\\n\\nYes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!\"].\nReshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.",

'\n '\\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\"\n '\\n\\n  So.  If I can scrounge up a good looking CX500 Turbo, will someone\\n  trade me an MHR Duc for it?\\n\\n\\n\\n==============================================================================='\n \"One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that\\nwithout bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup.\\nIt almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to\\ntear apart.

The attempts to quiet any violence\\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \\n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\\n\\n\\n\\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\\n    racist ommission on your part.\\n\\n\\n\\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\\n    also recognized by international law.

Do you believe that all Jews must have   \\n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \\n    \\n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \\n    race,' for you to avoid...\\n\\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\\n    in Lebanon.  \\n\\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \\n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \\n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \\n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \\n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\\n    manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \\n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   This attitude\\n\\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Where is this quote?

Since you are in general a liar, you'll\\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually\\n    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what\\n    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,\\n    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an\\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \\n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \\n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \\n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \\n\\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \\n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \\n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \\n    appear to be.

It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n'\n '88 toyota Camry - Top Of The Line Vehicle\\nblue book $10,500\\nasking 9,900.\\n\\n73 k miles\\nauto transmission\\n \\nHas Everything!\\n\\nowned by a meticulous automoble mechanic\\n\\ncall (408) 425-8203 ask for Bob.'\n \"\\nHad an '83 Alliance for a long time.

What you are saying is\\nmore or less heresy.  You might call it \"infallibilism\".  It\\'s the\\nidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.\\nThis is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.\\n\\nThe Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and\\nwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can\\nmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.\\n\\nA couple historical examples come to mind.\\n\\nBishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the\\nEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning\\nPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop\\nGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though\\nmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even\\nwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just\\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\\n\\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn\\'t quite get around to\\ndefining it.  Now there\\'s no way this is compatible with Catholic\\ndoctrine.  The Pope\\'s doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\\nChurch.\\n\\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\\ninto heresy or schism.'\n '\\nThere is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the\\nsame side).

First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.'\n '...\\n\\nIn reply to mail queries; I don\\'t know if a video is available yet.

It sounds a lot like\\nwhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn\\'t like that and\\nI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.\\n\\nOh and by the way, I don\\'t expect it to happen once.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\\n\\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\\n   Pope\\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.'\n \"  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the\\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.\\n  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole\\ndebate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the\\nfield say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the\\nFeds.

Deputy\\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\\n\\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\\n\\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\\n\\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\\nStriker, the Weaver\\'s yellow lab, started toward them barking\\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\\n\\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\\n\\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\\n\\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\\nand fired.  He didn\\'t bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\\nBill\\'s arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\\n\\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn\\'t you?\"  Nevin also\\npointed out that in last September\\'s testimony, Cooper had\\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\\ndecided that Thursday\\'s account was correct.  Nevin continued the\\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\\nhim [no answer was available].\\n\\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\\n\\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\\n\\nDrew\\n==============================================================\\n'\n '\\n\\nIf a landlord sells an apartment building \"vacant\" to another landlord\\nand fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out\\non the street all of a sudden.

The structure \\nof the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but \\nfighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have \\ncomfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can\\'t really have the former, \\nin the long term, unless you have the latter.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird \\ncross between a libertarian and an \"establishment tool\" is that I end up \\ntaking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don\\'t get up in arms when \\nthe government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my \\nlifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  \\n\\nAs a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government \\nto be \"fair\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, \\nwhether or not it is legal at the time.

If it\\'s legal, \\nso much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) \\nsense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth \\nit.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its \\ncitizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the \\nmajor architects of the American system of government, figured that in a \\ncouple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it \\nwould be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.

Most implementations support the X Window System and take\\nadvantage of a 3D extension to X called \"PEX\".  PEXlib is a slightly\\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\\nextension to X.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\\n- Is free of \"policy\"\\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re working strictly in X and don\\'t care about things like\\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

Normally, the older boards have\\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\\nthey received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the\\nright software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. \\n\\n\\nIf you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a\\ntime and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are\\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \\n\\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\\n\\n\\nNO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,\\nwhereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port\\nwhich has the UART on board.\\n\\n\\nI use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0.

My\\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\\nfinances.\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\\n\\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\\n\\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\\n\\tbudget.\\n\\n\\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\\n\\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\\n\\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\\n\\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\\'m not sure about it.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\\n\\tprograms.\\n\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\\nQuicken does not:\\n\\n\\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\\n\\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\\'s usefull to fine\\n\\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\\'t get his due too early.\\n\\n\\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\\n\\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\\n\\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\\n\\n\\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \\n\\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\\n\\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\\n\\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \\n\\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\\n\\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\\n\\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\\n\\ta particular investment\\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\\n\\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\\n\\tyour kids with their tuition.  \\n\\n\\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\\n\\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \\n\\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\\n\\tare automatically included here.\\n\\n\\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\\n\\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\\n\\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\\n\\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\\n\\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\\n\\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\\n\\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\\n\\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\\'m almost\\nsure that Quicken doesn\\'t do everything I\\'ve listed.  If I\\'m wrong, I\\'m sure\\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\\n\\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \\nWindows version.

Luke's prolog is\\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \\n\\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\\n\\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\\nCentury.

I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because\\nmy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines\\nand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better\\nwarrantee (2 years).

But\\nthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to \\nconsider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with \\nfireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000\\n(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes\\neach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find\\nthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are\\nhomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately\\n5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides\\nand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to \\nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \\nThat doesn\\'t sound like a net benefit to me.\\n  \\n\\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\\nsupporting \"reasonable\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \\nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that\\'s what you\\nare supporting.\\n\\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn\\'t significant next to \\nother household accidents.\\n\\n\\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \\ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\\nfalls.

It \\n->makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollo\\'s book- liar, \\n->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he \\n->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity, \\n->in the process he became a Christian himself.\\n\\nSounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he \\nbelong to? Does it have a name?\\n\\n->\\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a \\n->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.\\n\\nLogic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been\\nthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not \\nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\\n\\n->\\tSome reasons why he wouldn\\'t be a liar are as follows.  Who would \\n->die for a lie?  Wouldn\\'t people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \\n->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \\n->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did \\n->heal people.  \\n\\n\\nLogic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn\\'t\\nmean that it isn\\'t true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\\nHe has followers that don\\'t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \\nhe believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \\nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,\\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\\n\\n->\\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \\n->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \\n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \\n->this right away.\\n->\\tTherefore since he wasn\\'t a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \\n->real thing.  \\n\\n\\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \\npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n->write I will use it.\\n\\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to make\\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \\nfullfilled them anyway.\\n\\n->\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \\n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.  That\\'s tuff and most people don\\'t want to do it, to be a \\n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But \\n->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \\n->time.  We don\\'t rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \\n->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \\n->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this \\n->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be \\n->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \\n->ourselves.  \\n\\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \\nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \\nXians that don\\'t.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing\\nthat I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nJim\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJames L.

Although it would be\\ninteresting if they were selling \"virtual clothing\"....\\n\\nE-mail me if you want me to dig up their phone # and you can probably get\\nsome promotional lit.'\n '\\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call.

On the\\n-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.\\n\\nNo, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \"a little bit\\nand an anachronism.\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are\\nan anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the \\npeople.  These representatives of the people have already decided\\nthat the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\\ncases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \\ninterpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\\nof the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\\nof the people using their power of government.  If this is not\\nhow the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.\\n \\n-> RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated\\n-> militia.

This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \\nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \\nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \\nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \\nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.

And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \\nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \\ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \\nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \\non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \\nthat and get cloture?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \\nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \\nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \\ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \\nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \\nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \\npressure not to do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \\nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \\neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \\nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \\nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.

Mostly, that means water\\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \\nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\\n\\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\"\n \"\\n\\tI totally agree with each point you made.

Actions\\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\\n\\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\\n\\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \\nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\\n\\nThis gives us confidence.

I don\\'t know if it\\nis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the\\nmail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a\\nUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail\\nis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.\\nMost messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail\\non the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.\\nWhere ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header\\nthen a message saying \"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\".  If you\\ncan stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people\\nof course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably\\nthe problem.

End of part 10 of 14 --------\\n'\n 'Hello,\\n\\nI already tried our national news group without success.\\n\\nI tried to replace a friend\\'s original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC\\nwith a normal TEAC drive.\\nI already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted\\npin 6 (5.25\"/3.5\" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins\\n8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.\\nThe computer doesn\\'t complain about a missing FD, but the FD\\'s light\\nstays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,\\nbut I can\\'t access it.\\nThe TEAC works fine in a normal PC.\\n\\nAre there any points I missed?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\tVolkmar\\n'\n \"\\nIf he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the\\none who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*\\nbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\\nthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\\nOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\\nimprove on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\\nendeavor).\\n\\n\\nDo you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?\\nAre you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management\\npolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or\\ndecrease available traction?  Braking?\\n\\nIt is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum\\nswerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most\\nof his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency\\nsituation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.\\n\\n\\nI disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which\\nteach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner\\nthat is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the\\ncourse.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that\\npoint, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a\\nrider's ability.

You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \\nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).

Science is a human activity and as such,\\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\n: So, back to the original question:\\n\\n: And objective morality is.....?\\n\\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \\nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\nobjective sense.\\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\ninfinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\ndoesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.

Since standard colormaps\\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\\nCLUT.\\n\\nI don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's\\ncalled under X11R5).\\n\\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\\nthat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one\\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\\n\\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\\n-- \"\n '\\n\\nBowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style\\nplayer.

'\n 'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object.

Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\\n   any specified angle.\\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\\n   region of an image.\\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\\n   keyword values for a set of images.\\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.'\n '\\nWhere did you read this?  I don\\'t think this is true.  I think most\\nmedical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult\\nto prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some\\nthings that have just been found \"to work\", but we have no good\\nexplanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific\\nrationale.  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is\\nprobably hormone therapy.  It has been \"proven\" to work.  So have\\nradiation and chemotherapy.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\\n\"\n '\\n\\nWell, it\\'s obvious that you *don\\'t* attempt, otherwise you would be aware\\nthat they *don\\'t* all \"loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian\".\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to avoid using the phrase \"is/is not christian\" because of these\\nownership issues; instead, I\\'ve tried the phrase \"Nicene christianity\" in an\\nattempt to identify the vast majority of \"christianity\" which has roughly\\nsimilar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall\\nwithin this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is\\nrejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well.'\n 'Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape\\nis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are \\nvery different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While\\nthere is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to\\nget your hands on and costs quite a bit.\\n\\n\\tIf you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an\\nNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by\\nmodem and tape them from the NTSC output.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n'\n '\\nThe computer, err, government, is your friend.

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt?

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality\\nat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs\\nrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason\\nfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the\\nmarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font\\nvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being\\nhand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted\\nTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.\\n\\nTrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting\\nof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the\\nWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can\\nbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not\\njust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.\\n\\n\\nAgain, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone\\nconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT\\nallows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs\\nin a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate\\nfor the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack\\n2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that\\nif the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.\\n\\n\\n\\nHope this clears up some of the confusion.

Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

Related FAQ\\'s\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\\n\\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \\ncomp.windows.x.  \\n\\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \\nto comp.windows.x.motif.\\n\\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\\nlittle harder because you\\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\\n\\n/*\\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\\n * than the default visual.\\n *\\n * To compile:\\n *\\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\\n *\\n * To run:\\n *\\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\\n *\\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\\n * to install.\\n */\\n\\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\\n\\ntypedef struct\\n{\\n\\tVisual\\t*visual;\\n\\tint\\tdepth;\\n} OptionsRec;\\n\\nOptionsRec\\tOptions;\\n\\nXtResource resources[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n\\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n};\\n\\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\\n\\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\\n};\\n\\n\\n\\nint\\nmain (argc, argv)\\n\\tint\\t\\targc;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**argv;\\n{\\n\\tXtAppContext\\tapp;\\t\\t/* the application context */\\n\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\t\\t/* toplevel widget */\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\t\\t/* display */\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**xargv;\\t/* saved argument vector */\\n\\tint\\t\\txargc;\\t\\t/* saved argument count */\\n\\tColormap\\tcolormap;\\t/* created colormap */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\tvinfo;\\t\\t/* template for find visual */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\t*vinfo_list;\\t/* returned list of visuals */\\n\\tint\\t\\tcount;\\t\\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\\n\\tArg\\t\\targs[10];\\n\\tCardinal\\tcnt;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*name = \"test\";\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*class = \"Test\";\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * save the command line arguments\\n\\t */\\n\\n\\txargc = argc;\\n\\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\\n\\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\\n\\t */\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\\n\\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   XtNumber (resources),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   args, cnt);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\\n\\t\\t/*\\n\\t\\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13.

What Widgets are available?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are three popular widget sets:\\n\\nAthena\\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\\n\\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\\n\\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\\nMotif\\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\\n\\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\\n\\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\\n\\t  it is poorly implemented.\\nOLIT\\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\\n\\t  implementing Sun\\'s Open Look specification.  Developed by\\n\\t  AT&T.  I\\'ve never used it so can\\'t comment on its quality.\\n\\t  I\\'ve heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\\n\\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\\n\\nXtra\\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\\n\\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\\n\\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\\n\\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I\\'ve never seen\\n\\t  them so I can\\'t comment.\\nFWF\\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\\n\\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\\n\\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\\n\\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\\n\\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\\nXcu\\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\\n\\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\\n\\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\\n\\t  widely used.\\nXs\\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\\n\\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\\nXw\\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\\n\\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\\n\\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\\n\\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\\n\\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\\n\\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\\nXo\\t- A widget set I\\'m working on.  It\\'s still primitive but you\\n\\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\\n\\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\\n\\nTbl\\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tName\\t\\tLanguage\\tVendor\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tXview\\t\\tC\\t\\tSun\\n\\tOI\\t\\tC++\\t\\tParcPlace\\n\\tInterviews\\tC++\\t\\tStanford\\n\\tTcl/tk\\t\\tC\\t\\tsprite.berkeley.edu\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\n\\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\\n\\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\\n\\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\\nprotocol for doing drag \\'n drop operations between clients.  My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\\nanyway.\\n\\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

'\n 'Kevin Mitchell\\'s sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \\npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \\nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \\nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker\\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a \\nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\\n\\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \\nargued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\\ntossed.\\n\\nThe Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \\nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s\\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson\\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\\n\\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\\n(Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\\n\\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended\\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \\nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\\nwork, striking out three.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \\nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \\nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \\nStates Bill Clinton.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \\nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \\nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \\nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \\nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \\nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \\nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \\nfound not guilty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \\nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \\nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \\nadministration and what you're trying to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \\nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \\ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \\nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \\ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \\ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \\nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \\nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \\nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \\nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \\nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \\nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \\nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \\nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \\nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \\ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \\nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \\npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \\ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \\neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \\nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \\nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \\nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \\nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \\nviolence and drugs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \\nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \\nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \\nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \\nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \\nproblems as we do.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \\ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \\nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \\nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \\nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \\nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \\ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \\nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \\nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \\nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \\nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \\nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \\nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \\nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \\nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \\nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \\nbattle?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \\nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \\nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \\neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \\ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \\nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \\nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \\nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \\nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \\nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \\nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \\nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \\nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \\nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \\nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \\nto a vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \\nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \\nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \\nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \\nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \\ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \\nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \\nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \\neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \\nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \\nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \\nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \\nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \\nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \\ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \\nhis office lately?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \\nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \\noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \\nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \\nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \\nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \\nof the budget I presented.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \\ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \\nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \\nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \\nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \\nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \\nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \\nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \\nputting the American people back to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \\nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \\nthe need for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have some questions from people who supported \\nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \\nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \\nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \\nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \\nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \\nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \\nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \\nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \\nit was going to be like this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \\npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \\nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \\nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \\nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \\nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \\npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \\nwide range of things.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \\nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \\nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \\nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \\nreal, real progress.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \\nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \\nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \\nthings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Thank you very much.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \\nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Starting lines:\\n\\n \\tSWEDEN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFINLAND\\n\\n  35.

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\\n\\nTo quote from H.S.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \"\n '\\n\\n     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.

Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain.

With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain.

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.

Personal\\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I\\'d\\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \\n \\n\\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \\ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \\npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\\n\\n\\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \\nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \\npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\\nexplore as much as possible.

A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up.

Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.

But the government announced strict security measures\\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\\n\\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\\n\\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\\nwar they say is not theirs.\\n\\n\"I have been drafted, but I won\\'t go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\\n\\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\\n\\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor\\'s office, said only 11 of 300 locals\\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\\n\\n\"The police don\\'t force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\\n\\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\\n\\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\\n\\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\\n\\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \\nthe Russians.\"\\n\\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\\n\\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \\n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\\n\\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\\nBut Baku won\\'t listen to us.\"\\n\\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \\njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\\n\\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\\n\\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \\nschool classes in their language.\\n\\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \\nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\\nAzerbaijan.\\n\\n\\n\\n'\n '\\nNever had any problem with mine...\\n\\nAre you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2\" hex?  13mm\\nis just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won\\'t fit on a GM 13mm\\nnut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric\\nthreads too.

In most of this thread, I have\\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\\nwhat is not. \\n\\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose your\\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\\ndo this.  \\n\\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \\n\\n\\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \\nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\\npresence of qi.\\n\\n\\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let\\'s face it: we cannot\\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. '\n 'I have a pair of car speakers for sale.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     '\n 'I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of\\ncryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment;\\nthe theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one\\'s personal\\n*thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable.\\n\\nPerhaps if we make a *treaty* with, say, Iceland, to restrict crypto\\nparaphernalia can a good \"end run\" around the Constitution happen...\\n(Treaties -- as someone pointed out -- has the force of any other \"law of\\nthe land\".

I was referring to the fact\\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \\'30\\'s.  For much\\nof the \\'20\\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It\\'s important to note that\\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\\'s _America_.  \"When it\\'s time to railroad,\\nyou railroad.\"\\n\\n\\n  Not off the top of my head; I\\'ll have to dig out my reference books again.\\nHowever, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the\\nNavigator\\'s Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and\\nmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be\\nshared.\\n\\n\\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\\ncan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\\nOrteig\\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\\na gov\\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\\nasked.\\n'\n '\\n\\tSerum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.

Teitz, editor; W. B.\\n\\tSaunders, 1987:\\n\\n\\tHuman glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.\\n\\n\\n\\tIndeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not\\n\\tas accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is\\n\\tthat cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the\\n\\tsample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,\\n\\thowever, results compare \"reasonably well\" with laboratory results,\\n\\talthough \"values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,\\n\\twhereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic.\"\\n\\n\\n\\tAs stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 \\n\\tpercent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect\\n\\twhole blood levels, however.  I don\\'t believe there is a well-\\n\\tdefined \"conversion factor,\" since cell metabolism will affect\\n\\tsamples to varying degrees.

Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \\npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \\nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.

If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #\\'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:\\n\\n02106@chopin.udel.edu or\\n02106@ravel.udel.edu or\\n02106@bach.udel.edu or\\n02106@brahms.udel.edu\\n\\nNO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!\\nLOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!\\n\\nShipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).\\n\\nFor all those who have bought comics

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

Kings'\n \"I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by\\nbuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile\\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\\nrandom 50mV bias.\\n\\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\\na pain in  the ass.\\n\\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\\nlike to have this box not be active.\\n\\tAny quick ideas.

As far as\\n  I can tell, you\\'re proposing the following rules of engagement\\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\\n\\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\\n     provocation is required.\\n\\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\\n\\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\\n       as document checks.\\n\\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely \\'hostile\\' intent,\\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\\n       armed response.\\n\\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\\n       if necessary.'\n \"\\n\\n\\n\\nTry the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.\\nIt's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.\\n\\nIn the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.\\nAlso, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.\\n\\nThey also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software\\nengineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,\\nand some stuff about comms.   \\n\\nThe PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and \\nX Windows programming as well)\\nanyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending\\non your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.\\n\\nThe one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought\\ninvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -\\nthis would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but\\nwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough\\ncourse.\\n\\nYes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!\"].\nReshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample."
