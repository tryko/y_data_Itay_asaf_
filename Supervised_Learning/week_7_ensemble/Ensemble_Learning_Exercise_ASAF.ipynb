        "1.1. Compelete the skeleton class below (you should use scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeRegressor` model that the `TreeEnsemble` will use)\n",

        "  - `sample_sz` is the size of the sample set to use of each of the trees in the forest (chose the samples randomly, with or without repetition)\n",
        "  - `n_features` is the size of features to sample. This can be a natrual number > 0, or a ratio of the features as a number in range (0,1]\n",

That is, for each sample calculate the squared error using  predictions from the trees that do not contain x in their respective bootstrap sample, then average this score for all samples.
